# Troubleshooting

## General Tips

- Try fully restarting WSL by running `wsl --shutdown`
- Make sure that you are using the [Microsoft Store version](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P9TQF7MRM4R) of WSL
- Update WSL2 to the latest version
  - To update, run: `wsl --update`
  - To check which version you currently have installed, run `wsl --version`
    - The latest version can be found on the [Microsoft/WSL](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/releases/latest) repo
    - If this command does not work, you are probably not using the Microsoft Store version of WSL!
